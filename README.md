# K-mean-Clustering-Algorithm
K-mean clustering implementation

This repository contains code for a K-mean clustering algorithm implemented from lists in Python. The algorithm is applied to cluster 6400 yeast gene expression data, and the same data are used to train a BIRCH clustering model using Scikit-learn package. The code is part of a project in CS121 Intro to Bioinformatics class at UCLA during Winter quarter 2022.
